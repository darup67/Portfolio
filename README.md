# My Portfolio - Dhruv Patel :necktie: :briefcase:
 
# Overview

This is my latest updated portfolio. I got started with a template and used several 3rd party CSS styles and js libraries to make an elegant, pleasing user experience.


# Content

My site has the following content:

My name (with my titles/key skills scrolling on main page)

Links to my GitHub profile, LinkedIn page, and Athlinks page as well as your email address and phone number

A link to a PDF of my resume on resume page and home page

List of projects (more than 3). For each project make sure you have the following:

Project title

More details for each project when clicking including description, images and links

Link to the code on GitHub

Link to the deployed version (not on mobile apps)

External content:

Updated my LinkedIn page with the projects on this site

Updated the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem, how I solved it, and some information about technical approach. Most of this was already included

I put meaningful images for all of the projects. Each project has an icon that is the app icon and additional images are provided in the project details page
